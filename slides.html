					# Inventory Optimisation
					Luke Storry
 					---
					### Outline
					In this lunch and learn we will be talking through some of the techniques used on a recent project
					-  a discrete-event-simulation to forecast the availability of stock inventory
					-  python best practises 
					-  (depending on interest) using the Epsilon-Greedy RL algorithm to find optimised purchasing strategies
					---
					### Prior Experience
					üñê if:
					- seen python
					- used python
					- list comprehension
					- classes
					- generators
					- simpy
					---
					###  Client Problem
					- Having issues with Inventory management
					- Would like ____knowledge____ about impact of future plans
					- Could ____optimise____ future orders to save costs
					---
					### Why a Simulation?
					- have lots of domain knowledge, and full set of rules.
					- only have data about  (could run supervised learning)
					---

					### Discrete Events
					outline boxes with each discrete event
					- age +1 per day
					- weekly stock clearout
					- sales - random per day
					---
					## Live code time!
					---
					## Questions?
					---
					### Strategy-Optimisation strategy?
					- could do grid search all values
					- but simulation too expensive to exhaust.
					- random grid search not using prior knowledge
					- can't only use prior knowledge as causes local minima
					---
					faster optimal solution: Epsilon Greedy
					
					restaurant meal
					
					exploit vs explore

					action space of input changes rather than just grid of inputs
